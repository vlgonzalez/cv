                <h5>The 5 whys ,Affinity diagram ,fishbone diagram (“Ishikawa”),Flow diagrams,FMEA</h5>
                <p>5 whys: The method is based on the iteration of questions. The “5” is because it is usually the number of iterations necessary to solve a problem. It is not a rigid method, nor does it provide strict rules, its potential lies in its simplicity. With few resources, very positive results can be achieved.</p>
                <p>Affinity diagram:The objective is to increase the knowledge that one has about a problem, taking into account many points of view, investigating the possible effects that cause it.</p>
                <p>Fishbone diagram:It is based on graphically representing in a relational way a central trunk, which is a line in the horizontal plane, representing the problem to be analyzed.</p>
                <p>Flow diagrams:It is a diagram focused on the precise characterization of a process or group of processes based on its key elements. These elements are: Suppliers, Inputs, Sub-processes, Outputs and Customers. The name SIPOC is the acronym for these elements in English.</p>
                <p>FMEA: FMEA is based on the application of a procedure for classifying potential failures based on their severity, frequency and detection capacity.</p>
